# hello-world
A Podcast Network - Front-end Website and Back-end Hosting service **Ruby on Rails**
This is an open source project to help me create a functional and complete website for podcast hosting and networking. 

Currently we have a wordpress website as a hub for all of our current podcast members. I am looking to use Rails to create a more functional and complete service. 

The podcast network we dream of is one with a focus upon the members, hosts and audiences. 

We want to design a sleek and functional front end website to display all podcasts who join our network. Each show would have its own attractive audio player and an RSS to ensure the lastest updated episode is displayed with show notes. 

The homepage will aggrigate all the shows into a most recent list for fans to find with ease. 

The resource page will aggregate the podcast news from around the world into a single place.

A backend members only page will allow for each member to audit their own page and comments. 

The website would also be able to have podcast hosting capabilities. This is more complex and am happy to brainstorm with everyone. Ideally, secure member login with the ability to upload podcast episodes with indivdual artwork, stats displayed for each episode, provide an RSS feed for episode and complete series, multi-plaform submission. 

Looking forward to working on this with you all. 
Cheers
